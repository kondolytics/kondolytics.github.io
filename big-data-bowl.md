# Projects in Progress

## The Big Data Bowl Project (Coming Soon)

We are still working on this project and finding ways to increase the predicting performance of our model.  To see our progress, here is a link to the GitHub Repository as well as an updated markdown file.  So far, we are building an expected return yards metric where try to answer the question: 'how many yards is a player going to gain at the moment they catch the ball?'  

We are currently usign variables such as kick length, location the ball was caught, location of defenders, distance between returners and defenders, kick type, catch type and more.  We want to incorporate blockers by assigning them contributions to the play by assigning them Shapley values.  We also are exploring a possibility of implementing a nueral network over the times series data.

## Other Projects Currently in Progress

### Soccer Model 

Working for a professional development soccer team, our goal is to find the best players for the lowest dollars.  Our goal is to identify under-valued players, or players who perform extremely high with a low market price.  We will do this by building a model to see what about performance is correlated with market price?  Is it goals? Assists? Both?  Is there a way for us to create an efficiency metric?
