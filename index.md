## Projects

### [Big Data Bowl](/sample_page)
<img src="images/Big Data Bowl.jpg?raw=true"/>

Our submission to the 2022 NFL Big Data Bowl will include generating an 'expected return yards' metric from the moment the player catches the ball.  The project takes player tracking data and uses variables such as kick length, hang time, distance, speed, and acceleration of the kickoff team to predict expected yards.  How a returner performs relative to the expected yards will determine how efficient a return is.

### [Analyzing Competitive Imbalance Problem in Major League Baseball](/pdf/How to Achieve Economic Equality in Major League Baseball.pdf)
<img src="images/Competitive Imbalance Blowout.jpg?raw=true"/>

This paper aims to identify why Major League Baseball has a competitive imbalance and economic inquality issue and how to fix it.  A few potential solutions are identified but the preferred solution is introducing a salary cap.  Although the MLBPA will never agree to this (hence the reason MLB is in the middle of a work stoppage), my paper discusses the implications of a salary cap and what it's implementation would look like.

In this project I do a brief study on the impact of team payroll on win percentage.  As expected, a higher payroll typically leads to a higher winning percentage.
